# SRP Meeting notes Thursday, 30.05.2024

## Members present:
Diego, Alex, Abin, Steve

## Presentation Feedback
* Graph on slide 12 is more confusing than helping
* Graphs on slide 13:
    * Add legend
    * Also only show best results and not all hyperparameter configurations
    * Mark decrease in LR (because Lars said so)
* Graph on slide 14/16 is very good!
* Use .pdf format next time 
* Include parameter count of models

## Experiments
* Downsampling from teacher may be a bad idea
    * Projector can reduce loss by returing zeroes which the student can then match
* Do hyperparameter search on validation set 
    * For CIFAR-100 -> 10k/5k of training data
* Linear projector:
    * Means way more parameters
        * We can test if its worth, i.e. the performance also increases
    * Pooling over filters looses spatial information
        * Can still try pooling over pixels in filters
* Use a different student model!
    * Current student model tops the performance of the teacher model in the baseline paper -> There is no room to improve
    * Consider using MobileNetV2, because its small and we have room to improve performance
        * If that works well also consider trying MobileNetV3
        * Both available on torchvision github
* Use target labels in the learning process!
    * Base paper shows that using only SimKD works best, so the true labels are not considered at all
    * Diego had the idea of using the loss between the logits of Teacher and Student, but weighing it by the performance of the teacher
        * i.e. when the teacher made a correct classification we let the student learn from it, if the teacher is wrong, the student doesn't learn from it

## Organisational
* Meetings with Diego now on demand (but at least once a month!)
* 2nd presentation 17.10.24 (thursday)
