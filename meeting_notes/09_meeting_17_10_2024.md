# SRP Meeting notes Thursday, 17.10.2024

## Members present:
Diego, Apurv, Abin, Steve

## Presentation
* For final presentation, only pick the best learning rate (or other hyperparameters) and comapare to other methods
* Present ratio of removed images when using the labels

## Planned experiments
* Run the vanilla SimKD setting so can compare our runs to baseline
1. **vanilla SimKD vs. using the labels**
    * Check with [Cosine, KL-div, L2]
2. **vanilla SimKD vs. Projector**
    * Check with [Cosine, KL-div, L2]
3. **Proj. (bias) vs. Proj. (unbiased/all layers)**
    * Putting one projector towards the is biased, because thats just what we think would work best. Doing unbiased projector experiments means putting a projecor between all layers.
        * If we run out of memory remove every other projector until we don't
    * Clarification: Projector at every layer means every student layer. Layer means a residual block, not actually the individual layers
    * Check with [Cosine, KL-div, L2]
4. (If we get performance lifts from any of these methods we can combine them, e.g. projector+labels vs. vanilla SimKD)

## Cluster
* Test partition works again
* There is now a limit for run time (3 days)
* If we need more, there is a partition to run for 10 days
* Cluster is offline so wandb doesn't work in online mode
