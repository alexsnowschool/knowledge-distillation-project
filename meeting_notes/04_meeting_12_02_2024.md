# SRP Meeting notes Monday, 12.02.2024

## Members present:
Diego, Alex, Abin, Apurv, Brhanu, Steve

## Meeting Content

* We presented our ideas to Diego and he gave us some feedack on it
    * Using KD for VT may be a good idea, but since VT need a lot of pre-training on big datasets it may not be feasable and we might want to go into another direction
    * Trying different losses (e.g. softmax, entropy, cosine-similariy) is a good idea but is not enough on it's own
        * However, it is a good baseline to have experiments on that for the **first presentation**
    * Having projectors in the earlier layers to align features could work but Diego has some concerns
        * To an extend we want the student model to arrive at the feature representations of the teacher in it's own way. Interfering in the earlier layers might force the student to behave very similar to teacher, resulting in worse performances because the student is simply not as strong as the teacher
        * Also we would have to deal with alot more hyperparameters, like which losses to use and how to weigh the importance of earier aligments compared to the later ones
* Diego also gave us the idea to combine KD with representation learning
    * He will send us some papers to we can get familiar with the topic 

## Administration
* Alex changed the cluster password on Diegos pc where the link worked. Using the cluster should still work on Alex's pc anyway

## TODO
* Concentrate ont the exams until 07.03 (Good luck everyone!)
* Write a first draft of the proposal and **meet with Diego on the 11.03** to talk about it (send it to him the day before so he can read through it before)
