# SRP Meeting notes Monday, 11.03.2024

## Members present:
Diego, Alex, Abin, Apurv, Brhanu, Steve

## Proposal
Diego gave us Feedback for the proposal draft we submitted the day prior
* Motivation
    * We explain KD by using the soft labels of the teacher model, but in our case we focus on representation learning, so we don't use them
* State-of-the-Art
    * Looks good, we show that we know he domain
* Research Idea
    * We should mention the baseline first and how they use the loss to align the features, then we can go into using different losses and representation learning
    * We should not directly mention the idea of using different projectors, but rather say that we want to do different ablation studies on representation learning
* Data Foundation
    * We could also mention CIFAR-10
* Timeline
    * Diego gave us some more guidance on a little bit more specific deadlines for the experiments and presentations
    * We should also include a time period after the last presentation for any additional changes that could come up

## Cluster
* If we don't have enough memory on the vram of the GPUs, we could first pass all the images through the teacher model and use the output as a separate dataset for the student model
    * However in that case we will not be able to do random augmentations so our performance will likely be a bit worse and we have to find other regularisation techniques to not overfit
    * Using augmentations only for the student gives worse results according to the literature (according to Diego)

## Next Meeting 11.04.24 10:15
* Try to get used to the cluster, maybe run some basic experiments and see if everything works
* From now on we plan to meet on thursdays instead of mondays
