## Members present:
Diego, Alex, Abin, Apurv, Brhanu, Steve

## Meeting Content

### Administration

* Presentation:
    1. Presentation: We should have the baseline implemented and some first ideas on what we want to improve on
        * This and the proposal are basically to get feedback from Lars and his approval on our ideas
    2. Presentation: Some first experiments should be running
    3. Presentation: Everything should be done and implemented
* Final submission:
    1. Paper: If results are good and we do ablation studies we can submit a paper and if we get accepted to a conference, we get an instant 1.0
    2. Report: Should be 30-40 papes containing all experiments, even the ones that failed
* We asked Diego how the presentations are graded, he will get back to us
* Diego wants to only communicate over email, no WhatsApp group
    * We can also reach out to him in the DL tutorials next semester
* Meeting frequency:
    * At least once a month with Diego 
    * Can have two meetings if we need, but not more
    * Meeting should be on Mondays 10:15 (MOT??)
* Alex will get acces to the cluster
    * She is responsible, but she will share the login information with the others (approved by Diego)

### Techincal stuff about KD
* Diego gave a basic intro into KD, presenting the basic approach and the approach in our baseline paper
* We probably want to stay in the image domain, since Diego is also more of a computer vision guy and can help us better
    * However we have to find something new in this already well explored domain
* Using CIFAR-10/100 is recommended so we don't overload the cluster
* We should always check if the student model is at least smaller than 10% of the teacher model

## TODO until next meeting with Diego (12.02.2024, 10:15)
* Go over material and get comfortable with the domain
* Come up with first ideas on how to improve on the baseline
* Look up vision transformers
* Apurv: Send email to Diego so he knows who to contact
